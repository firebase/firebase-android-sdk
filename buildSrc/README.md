## Build Source

This file will be more organized as time progresses. Because a lot of our
plugins and systems require a moderate amount of cognitive overhead to understand,
I thought it best to provide documentation for such systems. You can find the
currently documented systems below:

[Dackka Plugin](src/main/java/com/google/firebase/gradle/plugins/DackkaPlugin.kt)


* Note that this file currently only serves as a table of contents until sufficient documentation has been created.
