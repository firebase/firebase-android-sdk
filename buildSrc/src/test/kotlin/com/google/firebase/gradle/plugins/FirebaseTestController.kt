/**
 * Util class for providing a common ground for tests that need to dynamically create [projects]
 * [Project].
 *
 * This class effectively acts as the root controller during multi module testing. The general
 * workflow can be defined as such:
 * - Wrap your test in a [FirebaseTestController]
 * - Create your test [projects][Project]
 * - Link your test projects with the controller via [withProjects]
 * - Use the [GradleRunner] to run your build at the [rootDirectory]
 * - Use any of the provided extension methods to inspect the build files and make assertions in
 * your test
 *
 * Some example of the provided extension methods are:
 * - [Project.buildFile]
 * - [Project.pom]
 *
 * To see a more involved example of this workflow, you can take a look at test classes that
 * implement this class, eg; [UpdatePinnedDependenciesTests] and [PublishingPluginTests].
