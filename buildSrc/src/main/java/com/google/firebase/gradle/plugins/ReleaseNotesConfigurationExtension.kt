/**
 * Configuration options for release note generation of libraries.
 *
 * Also facilitates the centralization of certain externally defined data (usually defined on G3).
 * As we can't link G3 files on GitHub, if you're setting up a new SDK and are unsure what release
 * note mappings your SDK has (or will have) ask Rachel or the ACore team for the relevant variable
 * mappings.
 *
 * @property enabled Whether to generate release notes for this library. Defaults to true.
 * @property name The variable name mapping for this library, defined on G3.
 * @property versionName The version name mapping for this library, defined on G3.
 * @property hasKTX The library has a sub module with the suffix '-ktx' that releases alongside this
 *   library, and should have the transitive text added to the release notes. Defaults to true. Will
 *   likely be removed when we officially drop KTX libraries.
 * @property artifactName The name of the generation artifact. _Only_ required if your project's
 *   name is different than your generated artifact name. Defaults to the project name.
 * @see MakeReleaseNotesTask
