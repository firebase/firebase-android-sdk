When this happens, it was possible to set\n`responsePayloadBytes` to -1 because `-1 + 0 = -1`. I didn't just have\n`bytesRead` initialize to 0 because there is a difference between 0\nbytes read, and no read happened. Tested manually by hacking a test app\nto force this to happen, and by unit tests.",
