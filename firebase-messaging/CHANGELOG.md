  `firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has the following
  additional updates:

* [feature] Firebase now supports Kotlin coroutines.
  With this release, we added
  [`kotlinx-coroutines-play-services`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-play-services/){: .external}
  to `firebase-messaging-ktx` as a transitive dependency, which exposes the
  `Task<T>.await()` suspend function to convert a
  [`Task`](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/tasks) into a Kotlin
  coroutine.

`firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has no additional
updates.

# 23.0.6
* [changed] Added the `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission to enable posting

  an `Activity Intent` while checking for notification analytics data.

* [changed] Internal changes to notification building methods.


## Kotlin
The Kotlin extensions library transitively includes the updated
`firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has no additional
updates.

  the [firebase_bom_long] leaked the `httpcomponents` transitive dependencies.



## Kotlin
The Kotlin extensions library transitively includes the updated
`firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has no additional
updates.

# 23.0.1
* [changed] Updated to the latest version of the `firebase-datatransport`
  library.

* [changed] Updated dependencies of `play-services-basement`,
  `play-services-base`, and `play-services-tasks` to their latest versions
  (v18.0.0, v18.0.1, and v18.0.1, respectively). For more information, see the
  [note](#basement18-0-0_base18-0-1_tasks18-0-1) at the top of this release
  entry.

* [fixed] On Android 7.0 and earlier, the SDK now logs that a notification was
  opened after `onActivityCreated` to avoid a race condition when unparceling
  the extras Bundle.

* [fixed] Switched to stopping an image download by canceling a `Future` to
  interrupt the download thread. This change avoids errors that can occur in the
  image downloading library when trying to close the stream on a different thread
  than the one that started the download.

* [fixed] Fixed reference documentation for [`RemoteMessage.getMessageId()`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/RemoteMessage#public-string-getmessageid)
  and updated obsolete references to Google Cloud Messaging (GCM).


## Kotlin
The Kotlin extensions library transitively includes the updated
`firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has no additional
updates.

# 23.0.0
*   [changed] Due to its
    [dependency on Google Play services](/docs/android/android-play-services),
    this SDK now requires devices and emulators to target API level 19 (KitKat)
    or higher and to use Android 4.4 or higher.

*   [feature] Added methods for determining and controlling whether Google
    Play services is set as the app’s notification delegate. By default, FCM
    will now set Google Play services as the app’s notification delegate so
    that it is allowed to display notifications for the app. This could be used
    in the future to show an app’s notifications without needing to start the
    app, which may improve message reliability and timeliness.


## Kotlin
The Kotlin extensions library transitively includes the updated
`firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has no additional
updates.

# 22.0.0
*   [changed] Removed dependency on the deprecated Firebase Instance ID SDK.

    Caution: **This is a breaking change for apps that use [messaging] and the
    deprecated Firebase Instance ID API to manage registration tokens.**<br>We
    strongly recommend
    [migrating to [messaging]'s token APIs](/docs/projects/manage-installations#fid-iid).
    If you're unable to migrate to the replacement APIs, add a direct dependency
    on the `firebase-iid` library to your `build.gradle` file.

*   [feature] Changed to open an `Activity` directly when a notification is
    tapped instead of passing it through `FirebaseMessagingService`. This change
    is to comply with Android 12 notification trampoline restrictions.

*   [feature] Internal changes to use proto instead of JSON for logging.

*   [changed] Internal changes to support dynamic feature modules.

*   [changed] Internal infrastructure improvements.


## Kotlin
The Kotlin extensions library transitively includes the updated
`firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has no additional
updates.

# 21.1.0
*   [feature] Migrated internal handling of new token callbacks and
    notification actions from Firebase Instance ID to [firebase_messaging].

*   [feature] Added functionality to generate [messaging] tokens from
    `FirebaseMessaging.getToken`, while continuing to call through to Firebase
    Instance ID if it is present. This will allow [firebase_messaging] to
    remove its dependency on Firebase Instance ID in the future.


## Kotlin
The Kotlin extensions library transitively includes the updated
`firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has no additional
updates.

# 21.0.1
* [changed] Updated to latest version of the `firebase-datatransport` library.

* [feature] The SDK now gracefully handles missing default resources.


## Kotlin
The Kotlin extensions library transitively includes the updated
`firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has no additional
updates.

# 21.0.0
*   [feature] Migrated auto-initialization from Firebase Instance ID to
    [firebase_messaging].

*   [feature] Added a check for incompatible versions of Firebase Instance ID.
    An exception is thrown during instantiation if one is found.

*   [fixed] Fixed an issue where events were erronously logged to
    [firebase_analytics] twice.


## Kotlin
The Kotlin extensions library transitively includes the updated
`firebase-messaging` library. The Kotlin extensions library has no additional
updates.

# 20.3.0
* [feature] Added
  [`getToken`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/FirebaseMessaging.html#getToken())
  and
  [`deleteToken`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/FirebaseMessaging.html#deleteToken())
  methods directly to `FirebaseMessaging`.

* [changed] Internal changes to the Google Play services interface to improve
  future development velocity.


## Kotlin
* [feature] The [messaging_longer] Android library with Kotlin
  extensions is now available. The Kotlin extensions library transitively
  includes the base `firebase-messaging` library. To learn more,  visit the
  [[messaging_longer] KTX documentation](/docs/reference/kotlin/com/google/firebase/messaging/ktx/package-summary).

# 20.2.4

# 20.1.6
* [fixed] Fixed a bug in topic syncing that was causing increased usage of
  shared system resources when waiting for a working network connection.

# 20.1.5
Warning: In some cases, `firebase-messaging` v20.1.4 and v20.1.5 are erroneously
consuming system resources which can negatively impact the performance of a
user's device. To avoid this effect, **update your app's version of
`firebase-messaging` to
[v20.1.6](/support/release-notes/android#messaging_v20-1-6) or later**.

* [changed] Internal changes to ensure functionality alignment with other SDK releases.

# 20.1.4
Warning: In some cases, `firebase-messaging` v20.1.4 and v20.1.5 are erroneously
consuming system resources which can negatively impact the performance of a
user's device. To avoid this effect, **update your app's version of

# 20.1.1
Warning: This version of `firebase-messaging` (v20.1.1) has known issues
involving silent failures and should not be used. A fix for these issues was
released on [March 03, 2020](/support/release-notes/android#2020-03-03).

* [changed] Changed the default for notification titles. Previously, an empty
  title was replaced with the app's label, but now an empty title causes the
  notification title to be omitted.

* [fixed] Fixed an issue that could cause ANRs when receiving messages.

* [changed] [messaging_longer] now transitively depends on the
  [installations_sdk]. After updating to the latest dependency versions, make
  sure that push notifications still work as expected. Also, be aware of the
  following:

  * The [messaging] registration tokens of installed instances of your apps
    might change once after updating dependencies to their latest versions. To
    learn if your apps are affected, review the
    <a href="//github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/blob/master/firebase-installations/FCM_TOKENS_CHANGE.md"
       class="external">[firebase_installations] documentation</a>. Also,
    make sure to
    <a href="/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#monitor-token-generation">monitor
      [messaging] registration token generation</a> using the
    <code>#onNewToken</code> implementation.

  * Apps that use the Firebase auto-initialization process and the Gradle plugin
    to convert `google-services.json` into resources are unaffected. However,
    apps that create their own `FirebaseOptions` instances must provide a valid
    API key, Firebase project ID, and application ID.

# 20.1.0
* [feature] Added
  [`setDeliveryMetricsExportToBigQuery(boolean)`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/FirebaseMessaging.html#setDeliveryMetricsExportToBigQuery(boolean))
  and
  [`deliveryMetricsExportToBigQueryEnabled()`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/FirebaseMessaging.html#deliveryMetricsExportToBigQueryEnabled())
  to control and query if messsage delivery metrics are exported to BigQuery.

* [changed] Changed to catch and log NullPointerException when trying to close
  the image download stream. This NPE can happen if the image download takes too
  long and times out.

# 20.0.1
* [fixed] Fixed notifications on API level 24 and later to display the event
  time when `event_time` is set.

# 20.0.0
* [feature] Added support for more Android notification parameters, including:
  `ticker`, `sticky`,`event_time`, `local_only`, `notification_priority`,
  `default_sound`, `default_vibrate_timings`, `default_light_settings`,
  `visibility`, `notification_count`, `vibrate_timings` and `light_settings`.

* [feature] Added support for Android notifications that include an image.

* [changed] Added nullability annotations to improve the Kotlin developer
  experience.

# 19.0.1
* [fixed] Fixed an issue where `FirebaseMessagingService.onNewToken` would be
  invoked for tokens created for non-default FirebaseApp instances.
* [fixed] SDK now only retries topic subscriptions and token registration on
  the following errors: "ERROR_SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE" and
  "ERROR_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR".

# 18.0.0
* [changed] Updated minSdkVersion to API level 16.

# 17.6.0
* [feature] Added functionality to automatically download and show an image in
  a notification message. Retrieve the image URL set in the message with the
  `getImageUrl` method in
  [`RemoteMessage.Notification`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/RemoteMessage.Notification).

# 17.5.0
* [changed] Added internal improvements and refactored code.

# 17.4.0
* [feature] Added `getChannelId` method to [`RemoteMessage.Notification`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/RemoteMessage.Notification) for getting the channel ID set in a notification message.
* [fixed] Fixed a rare `ClassCastException` while receiving a message.

# 17.3.4
* [fixed] Bug fixes and internal improvements.

# 17.3.2
* [fixed] Fixed an issue that would occasionally cause apps to crash with
  Android Not Responding (ANR) errors when receiving a message.

# 17.3.0

  changes. These changes do not affect client functionality, and developers
  do not need to take any action.

# 17.1.0
* [feature] Added `onNewToken` method to [`FirebaseMessagingService`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/FirebaseMessagingService) which is invoked when the app gets a new Instance ID token or its existing token changes.

# 17.0.0
* [feature] Added `getPriority()` and `getOriginalPriority()` methods to
  [`RemoteMessage`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/RemoteMessage).

* [changed] The methods `subscribeToTopic()` and `unsubscribeFromTopic()` on
  [`FirebaseMessaging`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/FirebaseMessaging)
  now return a
  [`Task`](/docs/reference/android/com/google/android/gms/tasks/Task) that can
  be used to see when the request has completed.
