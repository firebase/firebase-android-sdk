# Unreleased
* [feature] Adds support for in-app tester feedback. To learn more, see
  [Collect feedback from testers](/docs/app-distribution/collect-feedback-from-testers).
* [fixed] Fixed a bug where only the last listener added to an `UpdateTask` using
  `addOnProgressListener()` would receive updates.

# 16.0.0-beta05
* [unchanged] Updated to accommodate the release of the updated
  [appdistro] Kotlin extensions library.

# 16.0.0-beta03
* [feature] The [appdistro] SDK has been split into two libraries:

  * `firebase-appdistribution-api` - The API-only library<br>
    This new API-only library is functional only when the full
    [appdistro] SDK implementation (`firebase-appdistribution`) is present.
    `firebase-appdistribution-api` can be included in all
    [build variants](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants){: .external}.

  * `firebase-appdistribution` - The full SDK implementation<br>
    This full SDK implementation is optional and should only be included in
    pre-release builds.

  Visit the documentation to learn how to
  [add these SDKs](/docs/app-distribution/set-up-alerts?platform=android#add-appdistro)
  to your Android app.

  has been removed. All its functionality has been moved to the new API-only
  library: `firebase-appdistribution-api-ktx`.

* [fixed] Fixed a bug that prevented testers from signing in when the app had
an underscore in the package name.

additional updates.
