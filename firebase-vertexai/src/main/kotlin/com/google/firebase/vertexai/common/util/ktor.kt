 *     println("Received line: $it")
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Decodes a stream of JSON elements from the given [ByteReadChannel] into a [Flow] of objects of
 * type [T].
 *
 * This function takes in a stream of events, each with a set of named parts. Parts are separated by
 * an HTTP \r\n newline, events are separated by a double HTTP \r\n\r\n newline. This function
 * assumes every event will only contain a named "data" part with a JSON object. Each data JSON is
 * decoded into an instance of [T] and emitted as it is read from the channel.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * val json = Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true } // Create a Json instance with any configurations
 * val channel: ByteReadChannel = ByteReadChannel("data: {\"name\":\"Alice\"}\r\n\r\ndata: {\"name\":\"Bob\"}]")
 *

 *   println(person.name)
 * }

 * @param T The type of objects to decode from the JSON stream.
 * @param channel The [ByteReadChannel] from which the JSON stream will be read.
 * @return A [Flow] of objects of type [T].
 * @throws SerializationException in case of any decoding-specific error
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the decoded input is not a valid instance of [T]
