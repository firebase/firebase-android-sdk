# Unreleased
* [changed] **Renamed / Replaced:** Vertex AI in Firebase (`FirebaseVertexAI`) has been renamed and
 replaced by the new Firebase AI SDK: `FirebaseAI`. This is to accommodate the evolving set of
 supported features and services. Please migrate to the new `FirebaseAI` package. See details in the
 [migration guide](/docs/vertex-ai/migrate-to-latest-sdk).

 Note: Existing Vertex AI in Firebase users may continue to use the SDK and receive bug fixes but,
 going forward, new features will only be added into the new Firebase AI SDK.
* [changed] **Breaking Change**: Removed the `LiveContentResponse.Status` class, and instead have nested the status
  fields as properties of `LiveContentResponse`. (#6941)
* [changed] **Breaking Change**: Removed the `LiveContentResponse` class, and instead have provided subclasses
  of `LiveServerMessage` that match the responses from the model. (#6941)
* [feature] Added support for the `id` field on `FunctionResponsePart` and `FunctionCallPart`. (#6941)
* [feature] Added a helper field for getting all the `InlineDataPart` from a `GenerateContentResponse`. (#6941)

  [model documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/configure-safety-filters#how_to_configure_content_filters){: .external}
  for more information.

  Use the {{firebase_vertexai_sdk}} to call the {{gemini_api_vertexai_long}}
  directly from your app. This client SDK is built specifically for use with
  Android apps, offering security options against unauthorized clients
  as well as integrations with other Firebase services.
