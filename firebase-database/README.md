# firebase-database

This is the Realtime Database component of the Firebase Android SDK.

The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized
in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android,
and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically
receive updates with the newest data.

All Gradle commands should be run from the source root (which is one level up
from this folder). See the README.md in the source root for instructions on
publishing/testing the Realtime Database.
