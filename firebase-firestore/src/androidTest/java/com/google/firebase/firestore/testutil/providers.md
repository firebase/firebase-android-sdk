# FirestoreProvider README

## Overview

This file defines the interface for the `FirestoreProvider` class. An implementation of this
interface is statically injected at build time. The implementation _must_ have the following name or
else it will not be found: `com.google.firebase.firestore.testutil.provider.FirestoreProvider`.

The provider enables the test suite to access closed-source, integration testing components without
strongly depending on those components. As such, there are multiple implementations of the provider.
The production provider is safe for open-sourcing.

## Provider Locations

For simplicity, there is a subdirectory in testutil/ for each provider implementation. The
`hexa_provider` directory contains an implementation that connects to a Hexa environment via the
`HexaTestUtil` utility. This code has been moved out of `IntegrationTestUtil.java`.

Other providers: - `nightly_provider`: Supports running tests against nightly. - `prod_provider`:
Shouldn't be used internally, but is ready for open-source.

## Provider Implementation

Providers are Java classes with the following form. They must have a public, argumentless
constructor.

```java
package com.google.firebase.firestore.testutil.provider;

public class FirestoreProvider {
  public String firestoreHost();

  public String projectId();
}
```

Note, `firestoreHost` should return the host name, or the host and port, if not using port 443.
