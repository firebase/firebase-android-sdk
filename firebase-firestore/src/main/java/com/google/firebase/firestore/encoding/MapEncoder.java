 * Kotlin extension library has the following restrictions: Only @{@code Serializable} objects are
 * supported; object depth, defined as objects within objects, cannot be larger than 500;
 * (de)encoding lists of mixed data types, or lists of lists is not supported as they are not
 * considered as Kotlin serializable (serializers cannot be obtained at compile time).
