/**
 * Helpers for dealing with paths stored in SQLite.
 *
 * <p>Paths in their canonical string form do not sort as the server sorts them. Specifically the
 * server splits paths into segments first and then sorts, putting end-of-segment before any
 * character. In a UTF-8 string encoding the slash ('/') or dot ('.') that denotes the
 * end-of-segment naturally comes after other characters so the intent here is to encode the path
 * delimiters in such a way that the resulting strings sort naturally.
 *
 * <p>Paths are also used for prefix scans so it's important to distinguish whole segments from any
 * longer segments of which they might be a prefix. For example, it's important to make it possible
 * to scan documents in a collection "foo" without encountering documents in a collection "foobar".
 *
 * <p>Separate from the concerns about path ordering and separation, SQLite imposes additional
 * restrictions since it does not handle TEXT fields with embedded NUL bytes particularly well.
 * Rather than deal with these limitations, this implementation sidesteps the issue entirely by
 * avoiding NUL bytes in the output altogether.
 *
 * <p>Taken together this means paths when encoded for storage in SQLite have the following
 * characteristics:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Segment separators ("/" or ".") sort before everything else.
 *   <li>All paths have a trailing separator.
 *   <li>NUL bytes do not exist in the output, since SQLite doesn't treat them well.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Therefore paths are encoded into string form using the following rules:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>'\x01' is used as an escape character.
 *   <li>Path separators are encoded as "\x01\x01"
 *   <li>NUL bytes are encoded as "\x01\x10"
 *   <li>'\x01' is encoded as "\x01\x11"
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This encoding leaves some room between path separators and the NUL byte just in case we decide
 * to support integer document ids after all.
 *
 * <p>Note that characters treated specially by the backend (for example '.', '/', and '~') are not
 * treated specially here. This class assumes that any unescaping of path strings into actual Path
 * objects will handle these characters there.
