/**
 * Persistence is the lowest-level shared interface to persistent storage in Firestore.
 *
 * <p>Persistence is used to create MutationQueue and RemoteDocumentCache instances backed by
 * persistence (which might be in-memory or SQLite).
 *
 * <p>Persistence also exposes an API to run transactions against the backing store. All read and
 * write operations must be wrapped in a transaction. Implementations of Persistence only need to
 * guarantee that writes made against the transaction are not made to durable storage until the
 * transaction commits. Since memory-only storage components do not alter durable storage, they are
 * free to ignore the transaction.
 *
 * <p>This contract is enough to allow the LocalStore be be written independently of whether or not
 * the stored state actually is durably persisted. If persistent storage is enabled, writes are
 * grouped together to avoid inconsistent state that could cause crashes.
 *
 * <p>Concretely, when persistent storage is enabled, the persistent versions of MutationQueue,
 * RemoteDocumentCache, and others (the mutators) will defer their writes into a transaction. Once
 * the local store has completed one logical operation, it commits the transaction.
 *
 * <p>When persistent storage is disabled, the non-persistent versions of the mutators ignore the
 * transaction. This short-cut is allowed because memory-only storage leaves no state so it cannot
 * be inconsistent.
 *
 * <p>This simplifies the implementations of the mutators and allows memory-only implementations to
 * supplement the persistent ones without requiring any special dual-store implementation of
 * Persistence. The cost is that the LocalStore needs to be slightly careful about the order of its
 * reads and writes in order to avoid relying on being able to read back uncommitted writes.
