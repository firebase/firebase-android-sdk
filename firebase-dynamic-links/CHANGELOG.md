  to `firebase-dynamic-links-ktx` as a transitive dependency, which exposes the
  `Task<T>.await()` suspend function to convert a
  [`Task`](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/tasks) into a Kotlin
  coroutine.

# 19.0.0

# 16.1.3
* [fixed] Fixed an issue that caused short link creation to fail when creating
links through `FirebaseDynamicLinks.getInstance().createDynamicLink().buildShortDynamicLink()`
using Google Play Services 13.2.80 and FDL SDK 16.1.0. The issue only occurred
when creating shortening links from parameters, links created using
preconstructed long links from `setLongLink()` were unaffected. This fix also
addresses issues in newer versions of Google Play Services.
