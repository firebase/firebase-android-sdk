# Production Tests

The goal of these production tests is to do end-to-end testing for an actual
test app, hitting production backend. This test suite tests the common happy
use cases. For more nuanced testing, including binary path parsing or command
line flag parsing, rely on the integration tests instead.

These tests are not run in CI. They are meant to be run manually for validating
big changes, similar to how one would do manual testing via a test matrix.

### How to run

Before running the tests, you need to create a `local.properties` file in the root directory of the `firebase-android-sdk` project with the following properties:

```properties
sdk.dir=<path_to_android_sdk>
firebase.appId=<your_firebase_app_id>
firebase.projectNumber=<your_project_number>
```

- `firebase.appId`: The Firebase App ID of the app you want to use for testing.
- `firebase.projectNumber`: The project number of the Firebase project you want to use for testing.

You also need to set the `FIREBASE_TOKEN` environment variable with your Firebase token, which can be obtained by running `firebase login:ci`.

```bash
export FIREBASE_TOKEN=<your_firebase_token>
```

Once you have auth set up, run the tests on the command line:
```
./gradlew :firebase-appdistribution-gradle:prodTest
```
