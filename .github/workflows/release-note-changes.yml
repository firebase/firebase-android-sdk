          No release note changes were detected. If you made changes that should be
          present in the next release, ensure you've added an entry in the appropriate
          `CHANGELOG.md` file(s).
        message-failure: |
          A `CHANGELOG.md` file seems to not match the expected format.
          Please ensure your changelog files are following the format as
          defined in [our documentation](#).
