# firebase-storage

This is the Cloud Storage for Firebase component of the Firebase Android SDK.

Cloud Storage for Firebase is a powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service built
for Google scale. The Firebase SDKs for Cloud Storage add Google security to file uploads and
downloads for your Firebase apps, regardless of network quality. You can use our SDKs to store
images, audio, video, or other user-generated content. On the server, you can use Google Cloud
Storage, to access the same files.

All Gradle commands should be run from the source root (which is one level up
from this folder). See the README.md in the source root for instructions on
publishing/testing Firebase Storage.
