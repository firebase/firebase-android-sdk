# firebase-dataconnect

This is the Firebase Android Data Connect SDK.

## Building

All Gradle commands should be run from the source root (which is one level up
from this folder). See the README.md in the source root for instructions on
publishing/testing Firebase Data Connect.

To build Firebase Data Connect, from the source root run:
```bash
./gradlew :firebase-dataconnect:assembleRelease
```

## Unit Testing

To run unit tests for Firebase Data Connect, from the source root run:
```bash
./gradlew :firebase-dataconnect:check
```

## Integration Testing

Running integration tests requires a Firebase project because they connect to
the Firebase Data Connect backend.

See [here](../README.md#project-setup) for how to setup a project.

Once you setup the project, download `google-services.json` and place it in
the source root.

Make sure you have created a Firebase Data Connect instance for your project,
before you proceed.

By default, integration tests run against the Firebase Data Connect emulator.

### Setting up the Firebase Data Connect Emulator

The integration tests require that the Firebase Data Connect emulator is running
on port 9399, which is default when running it via the Data Connect Toolkit.

  * [Install the Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/).
    ```
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```
  * [Install the Firebase Data Connect
    emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/FIX_URL/security/test-rules-emulator#install_the_emulator).
    ```
    firebase setup:emulators:dataconnect
    ```
  * Run the emulator
    ```
    firebase emulators:start --only dataconnect
    ```
  * Select the `Firebase Data Connect Integration Tests (Firebase Data Connect
    Emulator)` run configuration to run all integration tests.

To run the integration tests against prod, select
`DataConnectProdIntegrationTest` run configuration.

### Run on Local Android Emulator

Then run:
```bash
./gradlew :firebase-dataconnect:connectedCheck
```

### Run on Firebase Test Lab

You can also test on Firebase Test Lab, which allow you to run the integration
tests on devices hosted in a Google data center.

See [here](../README.md#running-integration-tests-on-firebase-test-lab) for
instructions of how to setup Firebase Test Lab for your project.

Run:
```bash
./gradlew :firebase-dataconnect:deviceCheck
```

## Code Formatting

Run below to format Kotlin and Java code:
```bash
./gradlew :firebase-dataconnect:spotlessApply
```

See [here](../README.md#code-formatting) if you want to be able to format code
from within Android Studio.

## Build Local Jar of Firebase Data Connect SDK

```bash
./gradlew -PprojectsToPublish="firebase-dataconnect" publishReleasingLibrariesToMavenLocal
```

Developers may then take a dependency on these locally published versions by adding
the `mavenLocal()` repository to your [repositories
block](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html) in
your app module's build.gradle.

## Misc
After importing the project into Android Studio and building successfully
for the first time, Android Studio will delete the run configuration xml files
in `./idea/runConfigurations`. Undo these changes with the command:

```
$ git checkout .idea/runConfigurations
```
