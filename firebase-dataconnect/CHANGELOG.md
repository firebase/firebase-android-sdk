- [changed] Added hydration and dehydration logic for use in offline caching.
  [#7714](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/7714))

# 17.1.3

- [changed] Internal refactor for reporting "paths" in response data.
  [#7613](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/7613))

# 17.1.2

- [changed] Internal refactor for managing Auth and App Check tokens
  [#7485](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/7485))

# 17.1.1

- [changed] Internal refactor for managing Auth and App Check tokens
  ([#7484](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/7484)

# 17.1.0

- [fixed] Addressed minor reference documentation issues (#7399)
- [changed] Added classes `EnumValue` and `EnumValueSerializer`. These classes are identical to
  those produced by the Data Connect code generator; however, a future version of the code generator
  will start using these classes from the SDK rather than generating them.
  ([#7153](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/7153))

# 17.0.1

- [changed] Bumped internal dependencies.
- [changed] Ignore unknown fields in response data instead of throwing a
  `DataConnectOperationException` with message "decoding data from the server's response failed: An
  unknown field for index -3" ([#7314](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/7314))

# 17.0.0

- [changed] **Breaking Change**: Updated minSdkVersion to API level 23 or higher.
- [changed] Removed superfluous and noisy debug logging of operation variables.

# 16.0.3

- [fixed] Fixed occasional `NullPointerException` when registering with FirebaseAuth, leading to
  erroneous UNAUTHENTICATED exceptions.
  ([#7001](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/7001))

# 16.0.2

- [changed] Improved code robustness related to state management in `FirebaseDataConnect` objects.
  ([#6861](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6861))

# 16.0.1

- [changed] Internal improvements.

# 16.0.0

- [changed] DataConnectOperationException added, enabling support for partial errors; that is, any
  data that was received and/or was able to be decoded is now available via the "response" property
  of the exception thrown when a query or mutation is executed.
  ([#6794](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6794))

# 16.0.0-beta05

- [changed] Changed gRPC proto package to v1 (was v1beta).
  ([#6729](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6729))

# 16.0.0-beta04

- [changed] `FirebaseDataConnect.logLevel` type changed from `LogLevel` to
  `MutableStateFlow<LogLevel>`. This enables apps to "collect" the flow to, for example, update a UI
  component when the log level changes.
  ([#6586](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6586))

# 16.0.0-beta03

- [changed] Requires Data Connect emulator version 1.6.1 or later for code generation.
- [feature] QueryRef and MutationRef gain methods copy(), withDataDeserializer(), and
  withVariablesSerializer(). ([#6424](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6424))
- [feature] GeneratedConnector gains methods copy(), operations(), queries(), and mutations().
  ([#6424](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6424))
- [feature] GeneratedQuery and GeneratedMutation gain methods copy(), withVariablesSerializer(), and
  withDataDeserializer(). ([#6424](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6424))
- [feature] GeneratedConnector, GeneratedQuery, and GeneratedMutation now must implement equals() to
  be a _logical_ comparsion, rather than just checking for _referencial_ equality using the `===`
  operator. ([#6424](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6424))
- [feature] ExperimentalFirebaseDataConnect annotation added, and some APIs have been annotated with
  it, requiring applications that make use of these experimental APIs to opt-in using
  `@OptIn(ExperimentalFirebaseDataConnect::class)` to suppress warnings or errors related to using
  these experimental APIs. ([#6424](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6424)) and
  ([#6433](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6433))
- [changed] Replaced java.util.Date with com.google.firebase.dataconnect.LocalDate.
  ([#6434](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6434))
- [changed] `DateSerializer` removed, as it is superceded by `LocalDateSerializer`. As of Data
  Connect emulator version 1.7.0, the generated Kotlin code uses
  `com.google.firebase.dataconnect.LocalDate` instead of `java.util.Date`. Therefore, this version
  of the SDK must be paired with code generated by version 1.7.0 (or later) of the Data Connect
  emulator. ([#6513](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6513))
- [feature] JavaTimeLocalDateSerializer and KotlinxDatetimeLocalDateSerializer added, to enable
  using the standard "local date" classes `java.time.LocalDate` and/or `kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate`
  instead of the bespoke `com.google.firebase.dataconnect.LocalDate` class for `Date` GraphQL fields
  and variables. ([#6519](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6519))

# 16.0.0-beta02

- [changed] Updated protobuf dependency to `3.25.5` to fix
  [CVE-2024-7254](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7254).

# 16.0.0-beta01

- [feature] Initial release of the Data Connect SDK (public preview). Learn how to
  [get started](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/android-sdk) with the SDK in your app.
- [feature] Added App Check support.
  ([#6176](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6176))
- [feature] Added `AnyValue` to support the `Any` custom GraphQL scalar type.
  ([#6285](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6285))
- [feature] Added `OrderDirection` enum support.
  ([#6307](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6307))
- [feature] Added ability to specify `SerializersModule` when serializing.
  ([#6297](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6297))
- [feature] Added `CallerSdkType`, which enables tracking of the generated SDK usage.
  ([#6298](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6298) and
  [#6179](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6179))
- [changed] Changed gRPC proto package to v1beta (was v1alpha).
  ([#6299](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6299))
- [changed] Added `equals` and `hashCode` methods to `GeneratedConnector`.
  ([#6177](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/pull/6177))
