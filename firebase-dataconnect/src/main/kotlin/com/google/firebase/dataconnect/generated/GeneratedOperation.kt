/**
 * The parent of [GeneratedQuery] and [GeneratedMutation], which are to be implemented by per-query
 * and per-mutation classes, respectively, generated by the Firebase Tools code generation.
 *
 * ### Safe for Concurrent Use
 *
 * All methods and properties of [GeneratedOperation] are thread-safe and may be safely called
 * and/or accessed concurrently from multiple threads and/or coroutines.
 *
 * ### Stable for Inheritance (after graduating to "Generally Available")
 *
 * The [GeneratedOperation] interface _is_ stable for inheritance in third-party libraries, as new
 * methods will not be added to this interface and contracts of the existing methods will not be
 * changed. Note, however, that this interface is still subject to changes, up to and including
 * outright deletion, until the Firebase Data Connect product graduates from "alpha" and/or "beta"
 * to "Generally Available" status.
