/**
 * A date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as {@code 2007-12-03}. This is
 * the default Kotlin type used to represent a `Date` GraphQL custom scalar in Firebase Data
 * Connect.
 *
 * ### Description (adapted from [java.time.LocalDate])
 *
 * [LocalDate] is an immutable date-time object that represents a date, often viewed as
 * year-month-day. For example, the value "2nd October 2007" can be stored in a [LocalDate].
 *
 * This class does not store or represent a time or time-zone. Instead, it is a description of the
 * date, as used for birthdays. It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional
 * information such as an offset or time-zone.
 *
 * ### Relationship to [java.time.LocalDate] and [kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate]
 *
 * This class exists solely to fill the gap for a "day-month-year" data type in Android API versions
 * less than 26. When the Firebase Android SDK updates its `minSdkVersion` to 26 or later, then this
 * class will be marked as "deprecated" and eventually removed.
 *
 * The [java.time.LocalDate] class was added in Android API 26 and should be used if it's available
 * instead of this class. If [java.time.LocalDate] is available then [kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate] is
 * a completely valid option as well, if it's desirable to take a dependency on
 * https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-datetime.
 *
 * Alternately, if your application has its `minSdkVersion` set to a value _less than_ 26, you can
 * use "desugaring" (https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support-table) to get access
 * [java.time.LocalDate] class regardless of the API version used at runtime.
 *
 * ### Using [java.time.LocalDate] and [kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate] in code generation.
 *
 * By default, the Firebase Data Connect code generation will use this class when generating code
 * for Kotlin. If, however, you want to use the preferable [java.time.LocalDate] or
 * [kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate] classes, add a `dateClass` entry in your `connector.yaml` set to the
 * fully-qualified class name that you'd like to use. For example,
 *
 * ```
 * connectorId: demo
 * authMode: PUBLIC
 * generate:
 *   kotlinSdk:
 *     outputDir: ../../.generated/demo
 *     dateClass: java.time.LocalDate # or kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate
 * ```
 *
 * ### Safe for Concurrent Use
 *
 * All methods and properties of [FirebaseDataConnect] are thread-safe and may be safely called
 * and/or accessed concurrently from multiple threads and/or coroutines.
 *
 * @property year The year. The valid range is between 1583 and 9999, inclusive; however, this is
 * _not_ checked or prevented by this class. Values less than 1583 are not forbidden; however, their
 * interpretation by the Data Connect backend is unspecified. See
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Years for more details.
 * @property month The month. The valid range is between 1 and 12, inclusive; however, this is _not_
 * checked or prevented by this class.
 * @property day The day of the month. The valid range is between 1 and 31, inclusive; however, this
 * is _not_ checked or prevented by this class.
