/**
 * The specialization of [GeneratedOperation] for queries.
 *
 * ### Safe for Concurrent Use
 *
 * All methods and properties of [GeneratedQuery] are thread-safe and may be safely called and/or
 * accessed concurrently from multiple threads and/or coroutines.
 *
 * ### Stable for Inheritance (after graduating to "Generally Available")
 *
 * The [GeneratedQuery] interface _is_ stable for inheritance in third-party libraries, as new
 * methods will not be added to this interface and contracts of the existing methods will not be
 * changed. Note, however, that this interface is still subject to changes, up to and including
 * outright deletion, until the Firebase Data Connect product graduates from "alpha" and/or "beta"
 * to "Generally Available" status.
