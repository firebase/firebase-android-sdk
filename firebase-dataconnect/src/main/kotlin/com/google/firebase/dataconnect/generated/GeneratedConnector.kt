 * The interface to be implemented by the over-arching "connector" classes that are generated by the

 * ### Safe for Concurrent Use
 *
 * All methods and properties of [GeneratedConnector] are thread-safe and may be safely called
 * and/or accessed concurrently from multiple threads and/or coroutines.
 *
 * ### Stable for Inheritance
 *
 * The [GeneratedConnector] interface _is_ stable for inheritance in third-party libraries, as new
 * methods will not be added to this interface and contracts of the existing methods will not be
 * changed, except possibly during major version number changes.
