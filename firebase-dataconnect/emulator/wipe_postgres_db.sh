# This script starts a postgresql server and pgadmin web interface using
# a docker image and the "podman" command. It is safe to run this script if the
# server is already running (it will just be a no-op).

# Shut down the pod, if it's running
podman pod stop dataconnect_postgres

# Delete the postgresql database
