 * Helper for executing tasks on the Crashlytics background executor service.

 * re-used while the worker queue is still blocked.
 *
 * <p>Work enqueued on this worker will be run serially, regardless of the underlying executor.
 * Therefore, workers on the queue should not add new work to the queue and then block on it, as
 * that would create a deadlock. In such a case, the worker can return a Task that depends on the
 * future work, and run the future work on the executor's thread, but not put it in the queue as its
 * own worker.
