This release for [firebase_crashlytics] includes the initial beta release of
the [firebase_crashlytics] SDK.

The [firebase_crashlytics] SDK is a new version of the [crashlytics] SDK
built _without_ Fabric and instead built entirely on Firebase. This new SDK has
new and improved APIs as well as an artifact name change.
The following release notes describe changes in the new SDK.

<aside class="note"><p>The changes in these release notes are only relevant to
  [crashlytics] users who are upgrading from the legacy Fabric SDK.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you're using [crashlytics] for NDK crash reporting in your app for
      the first time, follow the
      <a href="/docs/crashlytics/get-started-new-sdk?platform=android">getting
        started instructions</a>.
    </li>
    <li>If you're upgrading from the legacy Fabric SDK to the
      [firebase_crashlytics] SDK, follow the
      <a href="/docs/crashlytics/upgrade-sdk?platform=android">upgrade
        instructions</a> to update your app with the following SDK changes.
    </li>
  </ul>
</aside>

* [changed] Replaced static methods with new instance methods that are more
  consistent with other Firebase SDKs and more intuitive to use. The new APIs
  give your users more control over how you collect their data.
* [removed] Removed the Fabric [crashlytics] API key. Now, [crashlytics]
  will always use the `google-services.json` file to associate your app with your
  Firebase project. If you linked your app from Fabric, remove the Fabric API key
  from your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
* [removed] The `fabric.properties` and `crashlytics.properties` files are no
  longer supported. Remove them from your app.
